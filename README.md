# Deep-Learning-Implementation

An attempt to code differnt SOTA deep learning models using Tensorflow, Keras and PyTorch

### ResNet

Introduced by He et al. in Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition

Residual Networks, or ResNets, learn residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. Instead of hoping each few stacked layers directly fit a desired underlying mapping, residual nets let these layers fit a residual mapping. They stack residual blocks ontop of each other to form network: e.g. a ResNet-50 has fifty layers using these blocks.
