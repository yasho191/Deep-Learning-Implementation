# Deep-Learning-Implementation

An attempt to code differnt SOTA deep learning models using Tensorflow and PyTorch

## Alexnet

Designed by Alex Krizhevsky in collaboration with Ilya Sutskever and Geoffrey Hinton

AlexNet competed in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge on September 30, 2012. The network achieved a top-5 error of 15.3%, more than 10.8 percentage points lower than that of the runner up. The original paper's primary result was that the depth of the model was essential for its high performance, which was computationally expensive, but made feasible due to the utilization of graphics processing units (GPUs) during training.

## ResNet

Introduced by He et al. in Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition

Residual Networks, or ResNets, learn residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. Instead of hoping each few stacked layers directly fit a desired underlying mapping, residual nets let these layers fit a residual mapping. They stack residual blocks ontop of each other to form network: e.g. a ResNet-50 has fifty layers using these blocks.
